Atlantix Engineering Altium Libraries - Along with programmatically generated libraries 

The value of programmatically generated libraries is efficiency, reliability, and flexibility. The efficiency arrives by one person being able 
to generate an entire library whereas this would take weeks or months if done manually. The reliability comes from the program doing a 
repeated process, eliminating human error. Finally, there is the flexibility. If one wants to change the data fields for the library, this
can easily be done via the program. 

## Existing libraries created

The current libraries are focused on resistors. The current resistors generated are 0402, 0603, and 0805. The user could easily extend this to include 0201, as well as larger sizes such as 1206, 1210, and others. 

## Future work

Future work will focus on adding a GUI front end to the library generation, and extending the library creation to capacitors and other
components such as small signal diodes, zeners, and transistors.
