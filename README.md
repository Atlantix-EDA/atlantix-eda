# Atlantix-EDA
Programmatically generated PCB libraries facilitating robust electronic product design.

Atlantix-EDA enables electronic engineers to have fully customizable, rich libraries to employ in designs.
The Atlantix-EDA software tool suite *value position* is based upon programmatically generated libraries for PCB Design
with the advantages of:

   - Rapid design creation with consistant and comprehensive PCB libraries.

   - Higher productivity for individual engineers doing schematic, pcb, firmware, etc.

   - Versatile and flexible, as the libraries are programmatically generated by this software.

## Quick Start - CLI Tool

Atlantix-EDA now includes a unified command-line interface that supports both **KiCad** and **Altium** library generation. After cloning the repository, build and run:

```bash
# Build the CLI tool
cargo build --bin gen_resistor

# Generate KiCad libraries (symbols + footprints)
./target/debug/gen_resistor --format kicad --packages "0402,0603,0805,1206,1210,2512"

# Generate Altium CSV libraries
./target/debug/gen_resistor --format altium --packages "0402,0603,0805,1206"

# See all options
./target/debug/gen_resistor --help
```

**CLI Options:**
- `--format`: Choose `kicad` or `altium` output format
- `--packages`: Comma-separated list of package sizes (e.g., "0402,0603,0805,1206,1210,2512")  
- `--output-dir`: Output directory (default: "outputs")
- `--series`: E-series number - 96, 48, or 24 (default: 96)

**Optional: Install globally**
```bash
cargo install --path .
gen_resistor --format kicad --packages "0402,0603,0805,1206,1210,2512"
```

## Running the Legacy Example

The original Vishay resistor example is still available for backward compatibility:

```bash
cargo build 
cargo run --example gen_vishay_resistor
```

This generates Altium-compatible CSV files in the traditional format. 

 ## Software

 This software platform is built with the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language, offering a very robust
 systems programming language that is type and thread safe. Rust was chosen as the software for Atlantix-EDA
 because of these features and a forward looking vision incorprating advanced capabilities.

# Integration

## KiCad Integration âœ…

Atlantix-EDA now natively supports **KiCad** library generation:

- **Symbol Libraries**: Generates `.kicad_sym` files with proper S-expression format
- **Footprint Libraries**: Creates `.kicad_mod` files following IPC-7351 standards  
- **Package Support**: 0201, 0402, 0603, 0805, 1206, 1210, 2010, 2512
- **Import Process**: 
  1. Copy symbol files to your KiCad project or global library directory
  2. Copy the `.pretty` footprint directory to your KiCad footprint libraries
  3. Add libraries via Symbol Library Manager and Footprint Library Manager

## Altium Integration

Altium Designer database import is described here:   
<https://www.altium.com/documentation/altium-designer/working-with-database-libraries-ad>

The generated CSV files can be directly imported into Altium's Database Library system.

## Other EDA Tools

- **Fusion 360 (Eagle)**, **Cadence Allegro**, and **Mentor PADS**: Not currently supported but could be added
- **PADS**: Was tested with an older version of this software and should be easily adoptable

Overall, resistor libraries now support both KiCad and Altium, covering every E-96 value from 0201 to 2512 - over 5,000 parts per format.

# Background

For a complete resistor library from 0201 to 2512 in the E-96 1% series there are 5,184 resistor values. The ability to generate these libraries on the fly
and change any data associated with each part is quite powerful.

The use of Atlantix-EDA to generate the resistor library enables engineers developing in tools such as Altium, KiCad, etc. to have a comprehensive library 
available to them. This library enables quicker design cycles by
eliminating part creation and more robust design as BOM generation from the schematic will be accurate and true.

## Basic usage example
This basic example shows the generation of a 0603 library with
the decades ranging from 1 ohm to 1 Meg-Ohm

```rust
let decades = [1,10,100,1000,10000,100000];
let mut r0603 = component::Resistor::new(96, "0603".to_string());

for decade in decades.iter() {
r0603.generate(*decade);
}
```

## Detailed usage example
The code below shows how to actually instantiate the resistor object and generate
values across several decade values while writing to a file, which is then imported
by Altium or another tool.

```rust
fn main() {
 	let decades = [1,10,100,1000,10000,100000];
	let mut name_0402 : String = " ".to_string();

	let mut r0402 = component::Resistor::new(96, "0402".to_string());

	for decade in decades.iter() {
		name_0402 = r0402.generate(*decade);
	}

 	let mut file = OpenOptions::new()
                       .write(true)
                       .truncate(true)
                       .open("data.txt")
                       .expect("cannot open file");

			file.write_all(name_0402.as_bytes()).expect("write failed");

			println!("** Success::0402 resistor generation.");
 	}
```

# Future Developments
The next steps in this projects are to cover more vendors, such as 
1. KOA-Speer
2. Panasonic
3. Yageo

In this way, the program will be more complete in that the user can generate a library with 
any one of the vendors, or all of them, or a subset of them. 

A next step will be to expand the library to include current sending resistors, as are often
commonly used on board level power supplies.
